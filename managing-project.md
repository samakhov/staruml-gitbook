## New Project

To create a modeling project, press `Ctrl+N` or select **File | New**.


## New Project from Template

You can start a modeling project by selecting a template. To start a project with a template, select **File | New From Template | [TemplateName]**. StarUML supports 4 default templates:

* **UMLMinimal** - A single model with UML Standard Profile.
* **UMLConventional** - Use Case Model, Analysis Model, Design Model, Implementation Model, and Deployment Model with UML Standard Profile.
* **4+1 View Model** - Pilippe Kruchten's [4+1 Architectural View Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model).
* **Rational** : Approach of Rational Rose Tool.
* **Data Model** : A simple data modeling project.

If you don't want to use pre-defined templates, you need to make your own project structure.
